= Lab - Full Text Search

You need to have completed
link:Logging%20into%20Couchbase.md[Logging into
Couchbase] before starting this lab.

The lab here should take approximately 12 minutes to complete.


== Objective

This lab is designed to introduce you to the Full Text Search (FTS)
capabilities built into Couchbase. With many databases, FTS capabilities
are limited or non-existent, and are often farmed out to external tools
like Elasticsearch, Solr, etc. Elasticsearch is a powerful tool and
Couchbase does have an
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/connectors/elasticsearch-2.2/overview.html[Elasticsearch
plug-in] available. However, if you don’t need the full power of
Elasticsearch, Couchbase’s own FTS (built on the
http://www.blevesearch.com/[Bleve] engine) is a viable way of delivering
features without any extra integration work.

Couchbase’s FTS contains many options for searching and indexing. This
lab will only be scratching the surface. You are invited to check out
the
https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/fts/full-text-intro.html[extensive
FTS documentation] once you have a a handle for the basics.

This lab will not be covering any clients or SDK usage.

== Steps

=== Search feature

In the ``travel-sample'' bucket, there are a number of ``landmark''
documents. These landmarks documents contain information about places,
including address, city, geolocation, name, url, and a description
(content). Here’s an example document (key *landmark_11772*):

....
javascript
{
{
  "name": "The Griddle Café",
  "address": "7916 W Sunset Blvd",
  "url": "http://www.thegriddlecafe.com",
  "content": "The Griddle Café is the best breakfast experience in LA. It features pages of every type of pancake you can imagine, which also happen to be twice as large as any pancake you've ever had, and still manage to be fluffy-thick and light on the tummy. Coffee is fresh, in a French press, and the menu features more than just breakfast. Short story: Food is awesome, service is great, but its always crowded. Don't worry though, they serve fast and you will feel the wait is worth it.",
  "geo": {
    "lat": 34.097866,
    "lon": -118.36221,
    "accuracy": "ROOFTOP"
  },
  "type": "landmark",
  "state": "California",
  ...
}
....

Now put yourself in place of a user trying to find interesting places to
go. If that user searches ``breakfast'', should this document be in the
results? What about ``bed and breakfast''? Maybe it should appear, but
lower down the list in relevancy. What if your user types ``brakfast''
instead? These type of ``language aware'' queries that return results
with relevancy scores are difficult to do with the more exacting nature
of N1QL(3queryingwithn1ql.md).

=== Building an index

Let’s build a index to help our users find interesting results. But
let’s keep it very simple for this example.

From the Couchbase Console, go to ``Indexes'' then click ``Full Text''.

image::/images/4/0401-indexes-full-text.png[Full Text Search indexes]

Click the ``New Full Text Index'' button to create a new FTS index. I’ll
name the index ``travel-sample-idx''. Next, I’ll choose the
``travel-sample'' bucket. After that, I’ll expand the ``Type Mappings''
section. There’s already a ``default'' type mapping. If I saved this
index now, this index would search on every field in every document
(even airline documents, and even the geolocation fields and address
fields in landmark documents, which will not be helpful to a user
searching for ``breakfast'').

So, let’s narrow it down to just the content field.

Click ``Add Type Mapping''. Enter ``landmark'' as the type name. Notice
that the ``Type Identifier'' is set to ``JSON type field'' with a value
of ``type''. This is the default behavior. But as I mentioned in an
earlier lab, there’s nothing magical, special, or reserved about the
``type'' name. You can specify "_type" or ``doctype'' instead. Let’s
leave it as ``type'', since that’s what ``travel-sample'' uses.

Check the box ``only index specified field'' and click ``ok'' to save.

Next, we need to add a ``child field'' to this index. Right now, we only
want to index the `+content+` field of landmark documents. Hover over
the ``landmark'' record’s and the ``+'' button. Click ``insert child
field''. Enter ``content'' and the field and ``content'' as the
``searchable as''. Also check the ``store'' option (more on that later).
Click ``ok'' to save.

After that, hover over the ``default'' record, click ``edit'' and
uncheck the ``enabled'' option. We aren’t going to use the default
index, so this will save time when creating the initial index.

image::/images/4/0403-create-index.gif[Create index]

Finally, click the ``Create Index'' button. This will kick off the
initial indexing process. You can watch the progress on the following
screen (you will see both a ``doc count'' and an ``indexing progress''
percentage that will be updated automatically). Since this index is only
on ``landmark'' documents, and only one field within those documents,
the indexing should be done quickly. Further changes/additions to
documents will be automatically indexed on an incremental basis (or you
can manually update if you choose).

=== Executing a search

Now that we have a search index, let’s try out some searches. Click
``Full Text'' to back to the list of FTS indexes. Click the
``travel-sample-idx'' index and a ``search this index…'' text box will
appear. Enter a search term like ``breakfast'' and click ``Search''.

image::/images/4/0404-search-breakfast.png[Create index]

When searching for ``breakfast'', you should get 81 results. The most
relevant results will appear at the top (just like a web search engine).
You can check ``Show Scoring'' to see the actual score calculations if
you’d like.

image::/images/4/0405-search-results.png[Create index]

Try search for ``breakfast'' and then ``bed and breakfast''. The former
returns 81 results, the latter returns 85 results. Also notice that
document *landmark_2807* appears in the results of both: 2nd in the
former, 4th in the latter.

You can use a variety of operators within the search. You can use `+-+`
to specify that a term must _not_ be in the result, or `+++` to specify
that a term _must_ be in the result. You can also use the `+~+` to
specify a ``fuzziness''.

Try these searches and see what happens:

* `++bed -breakfast+`
* `+-bed +breakfast+`
* `+brakfast ~2+`
* `+"bed and breakfast"+`

Finally, notice that the search results show a snippet of text with the
relevant search terms highlighted (in yellow). When creating this index,
you checked the ``store'' option. If you didn’t check that option, you
wouldn’t get a the snippet and highlight: you would just get the
document key and a score.

== Summary

In this lab, you have learned the basics of using Couchbase Server’s
built in Full Text Search (FTS). You have learned how to create an
index, limit the scope of the index, and execute a search.
